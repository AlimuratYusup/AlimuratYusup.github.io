I'm an undergraduate student at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Archival Science at the [School of Information Management](https://sim.whu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm). I was originally admitted to an integrated B.S./M.S./Ph.D. honors program for gifted students, which I later chose to withdraw from in order to pursue a Ph.D. position abroad. Additionally, I minor in Computer Science through the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/english/index.htm). 

I am particularly interested in areas related to computer science and mathematics. Currently, I have research experience in document analysis and recognition, specifically focusing on complex scientific figure understanding using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). I also conduct research in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including LLM evaluation, understanding, and enhancement. 

I am also a marathon runner, having completed the Chengdu Marathon in October 2023 and the Wuhan Marathon in March 2024.
