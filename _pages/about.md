I'm an undergraduate student at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) , enrolled in [School of  Information Management](https://sim.whu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm)'s integrated B.S.–M.S.–Ph.D. program in Archival Science. Additionally, I minor in Computer Science through the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I am particularly interested in areas related to computer science and mathematics. Currently, I have research experience in Document Analysis and Recognition, specifically focusing on complex scientific figure understanding via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). I also conduct research in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including but not limited to LLM evaluation, understanding, and enhancement.
